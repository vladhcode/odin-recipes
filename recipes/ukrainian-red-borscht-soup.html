    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with meat stock and
      boiled vegetables. The Ukrainian version, which features beets, is perhaps
      the most well known type — but varieties of borscht can be found
      throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.

        Add sausage to pot, cover pot, and return to a boil. Add beets and
        simmer for 10 minutes. Add carrots and potatoes and continue to cook
        until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes more. Stir in cabbage and
        tomatoes.

        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender.
